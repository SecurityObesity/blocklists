# blocklists
Public blocklists that can be used for DNS blocking phishing, malware, tracking domains and more...

All blocklists that are available in this repository is not updated to current threats, but the blocklists try to get an active role to fight online threats and cybercrime. The internet evolves constantly with new online threats and the internet is most likely impossible to control and anti phishing filters can both be used to fight these online threats and increase online privacy.

Blocklists are added to a "Pi Hole Network-wide Ad blocking" for development, testing and deploy onto this repository.
